# smartGPT-Multi-Tab-Extension
The smartGPT Multi-Tab Resolver is a Chrome extension that allows users to interact with ChatGPT across multiple tabs to get more refined answers to their questions. 

This follows some of the ideas in "An automatically discovered chain-of-thought prompt generalizes to novel models and datasets"  Hebenstreit, Praas, Kiesewetter, Samwald.  The name was coined by the Youtube channel AI Explained.

We intend to develop this project to allow a wide selection of AI models, including but not limited to Vicuna and other Llama based models
